# Bytes code editor
The code editor based on Notepad was made for creating Java programs. This code editor uses basic file management systems such as creating, opening, and closing files.
It has the code runner functionality which helps users compile (if there are no errors) and run their compiled code in the window and shows the output on the same window itself.
